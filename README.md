Driver for Systemair Residential units, for communication via the Modbus RTU protocol.

You need minimalmodbus for this code to work

I've used a simple USB to RS485 Adapter http://www.dx.com/p/usb-to-rs485-adapter-black-green-296620

The timeout is sett higher than default on minimal modbus because I needed it to be able to connect with the ventilation unit
